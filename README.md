# **1.** Laptop Dataset Documentation

This dataset contains information about over 5800 laptops, including details such as company, model, display specifications, processor information, memory, graphics card, keyboard illumination, and price.

The dataset was compiled from diverse online sources, including manufacturer and retailer websites, as well as review platforms.

The dataset is suitable for research, education, and personal use.

## 1.2 Laptop Analysis Ideas

Here are some ideas for analyzing the laptop dataset:

- **Summary Statistics:**
  - Compute summary statistics for numerical columns (e.g., Display Height, Display Width, Display Size, Memory, RAM, Price). Include measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range.

- **Top Manufacturers and Models:**
  - Identify the most frequent laptop manufacturers and models in the dataset.

- **Display Size vs. Price Analysis:**
  - Visualize the relationship between display size and laptop price using a scatter plot. Determine if larger displays tend to have higher prices.

- **Processor Analysis:**
  - Group data by processor names or generations and calculate average prices, memory, RAM, etc. This analysis offers insights into commonly used processors and their characteristics.

- **Graphics Card Analysis:**
  - Explore the distribution of different graphics cards and their associated memory capacities. Visualize to understand popular graphics card choices.

- **Keyboard Illumination and Price Relationship:**
  - Investigate whether laptops with illuminated keyboards have varying price ranges. Utilize a box plot or bar chart to display this correlation.

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Calculate correlations between numerical variables (e.g., Display Size, Memory, RAM, Price) to uncover potential relationships or patterns.

- **Company Market Share:**
  - Calculate each company's market share based on the number of laptop models in the dataset.
